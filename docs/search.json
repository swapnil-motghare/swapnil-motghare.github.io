Labour Economics New York\r\nCity taxicab drivers worked fewer hours following a wage increase.\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\nI study how New York City taxicab drivers change their work hours in\r\nresponse to a permanent wage change. Exploiting the effective wage\r\nincrease induced by a regulatory change in fares, I estimate the\r\nlong-run elasticity of labor supply to be -0.5. I show that the data\r\nlimitations may have biased the estimates in a previous study that also\r\nuse data for New York City taxicab drivers. Since the drivers are almost\r\nexclusively males, the estimate likely represents male labor supply\r\nelasticity. The negative elasticity is consistent with rising wages and\r\ndeclining work hours per worker observed over many decades and is useful\r\nevidence for policymakers to improve tax/ transfer systems.Working papers\r\nContemporaneous and\r\nLasting Effects of Electoral Gender Quotas (Revision submitted,\r\nWorld Development)Gender quotas in India increased women representation without large\r\nnegative effects.\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\nThis paper examines several ways in which electoral gender quotas\r\naffect the political system. It uses data on reserved seat quotas for\r\nwomen in village councils in the Indian state of Jharkhand. Village\r\ncouncil head positions subjected to gender quotas continue to elect more\r\nwomen even after the quotas are no longer binding. Gender quotas do not\r\nhave spillover effects on other lower hierarchy positions in the\r\ncouncil. They reduce electoral competitiveness, but only in the first\r\nround of elections and only at council member position. They do not\r\naffect the caste composition of the winning candidates. These results\r\nsuggest that women’s representation may be achieved without large\r\nnegative effects and that temporary electoral gender quotas can be an\r\neffective policy tool to increase long-run women’s political\r\nrepresentation. The results are pertinent for affirmative action\r\npolicies addressing other forms of discrimination.\r\nUnemployment insurance\r\ngenerosity and labor supply - Evidence from the COVID-19\r\nrecessionUnemployment insurance during COVID-19 had a modest effect on\r\nIndiana’s unemployment and likely prevented labor force exits.\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\nI study the effect of Unemployment Insurance (UI) generosity during the\r\nCOVID-19 recession using administrative data on the universe of\r\nUnemployment Insurance claims for the state of Indiana. The\r\ndifference-in-difference identification strategy exploits the timing of\r\nthe expiration of the Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation (FPUC)\r\nand the Lost Wages Assistance (LWA) programs and the eligibility rule\r\nfor the LWA program, which paid eligible workers an extra $300 per week\r\nfor up to 6 weeks. A change in weekly benefit amount by $300 is\r\nassociated with a change in the exit rate out of unemployment by 2.1\r\npercentage points (p.p.) in the opposite direction. This is because of\r\nboth a decline in the reemployment rate (1.7 p. p.) which represents the\r\ndisincentive or the moral hazard effect of UI, and a decline in labor\r\nforce exits (0.4 p. p.) which suggests the ability of UI to keep workers\r\nin the labor force or the labor force participation effect. Access to\r\nsix weeks of increased benefit amounts did not change workers’\r\nprobability of switching employers, nor significantly affect their\r\nearnings after reemployment, suggesting worker-firm match quality was\r\nunaffected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPoster for AEA Annual Meeting\r\nResearch in progress\r\nEquity of COVID-19-induced job loss durationHow does the duration of unemployment during the COVID-19 pandemic\r\nvary by gender, race, and ethnicity?\r\nEvaluating Right-to-Work laws using Census data, (with Ye Ji\r\nKee and Yong Suk\r\nLee)How do RTW laws affect the labor market, automation technology\r\nadoption, and firm productivity?\r\nIntertemporal Elasticity of Labor Supply for Taxicab drivers:\r\nEvidence using a new instrumentDo workers work more when wages are high?\r\nPolicy reports\r\nImpact Evaluation: City of\r\nSouth Bend Commuters Trust Program, (with Danice Brown\r\nGuzmán)\r\nDashboard development\r\nSouth\r\nBend Economy Database\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
