Labour Economics New York\r\nCity taxicab drivers worked fewer hours following a wage increase.\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\nI study how New York City taxicab drivers change their work hours in\r\nresponse to a permanent wage change. Exploiting the effective wage\r\nincrease induced by a regulatory change in fares, I estimate the\r\nlong-run elasticity of labor supply to be -0.5. I show that the data\r\nlimitations may have biased the estimates in a previous study that also\r\nuse data for New York City taxicab drivers. Since the drivers are almost\r\nexclusively males, the estimate likely represents male labor supply\r\nelasticity. The negative elasticity is consistent with rising wages and\r\ndeclining work hours per worker observed over many decades and is useful\r\nevidence for policymakers to improve tax/ transfer systems.Working Papers\r\nContemporaneous and\r\nLasting Effects of Electoral Gender Quotas (Revision submitted,\r\nWorld Development)Gender quotas in India increased women representation without large\r\nnegative effects.\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\nThis paper examines several ways in which electoral gender quotas affect\r\nthe political system. It uses data on reserved seat quotas for women in\r\nvillage councils in the Indian state of Jharkhand. Village council head\r\npositions subjected to gender quotas continue to elect more women even\r\nafter the quotas are no longer binding. Gender quotas do not have\r\nspillover effects on other lower hierarchy positions in the council.\r\nThey reduce electoral competitiveness, but only in the first round of\r\nelections and only at council member position. They do not affect the\r\ncaste composition of the winning candidates. These results suggest that\r\nwomen’s representation may be achieved without large negative effects\r\nand that temporary electoral gender quotas can be an effective policy\r\ntool to increase long-run women’s political representation. The results\r\nare pertinent for affirmative action policies addressing other forms of\r\ndiscrimination.\r\nEquity of COVID-19-induced job loss\r\nduration and effect of unemployment insurance generosity on labor\r\nsupplyUnemployment insurance during COVID-19 had a small effect on\r\nIndiana’s unemployment.\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\nI study COVID-19-induced job losses using administrative data on the\r\nuniverse of Unemployment Insurance claims for the state of Indiana. I\r\nshow that during the pandemic, women and Blacks not only lost more jobs\r\nbut also stayed unemployed longer. I document sharp reductions in the\r\naggregate number of Unemployment Insurance recipients after the\r\nexpiration of the Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation (FPUC) and\r\nLost Wages Assistance (LWA) payments. Using difference-in-difference\r\nstrategy exploiting the eligibility for LWA benefits, I find that a\r\nchange in benefit amount by $300 per week is associated with a 30-35%\r\nchange in exit rate from unemployment in opposite direction. The\r\nunemployment rate in August 2020 would have been lower by 0.1 percentage\r\npoints if not for LWA. It is unlikely that these payments were a major\r\nfactor in explaining the difficulty business faced in finding workers in\r\nthe first half of 2021.\r\nResearch in progress\r\nIntertemporal Elasticity of Labor Supply for Taxicab drivers:\r\nEvidence using a new instrumentDo workers work more if wages are high?\r\nEvaluating Right-to-Work laws, (with Ye Ji Kee and Yong Suk\r\nLee)How do RTW laws affect the labor market, automation technology\r\nadoption, and firm productivity?\r\nNon-academic research\r\nDevelopment of an economy tracker for\r\nSouth Bend - Mishawaka regionPrincipal Investigator for work-travel transport subsidy\r\nprogram being implemented by the City of South Bend\r\n   - Report\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
