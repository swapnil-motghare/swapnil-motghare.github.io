Labour Economics New York\r\nCity taxicab drivers worked fewer hours following a wage increase.\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\nI study how New York City taxicab drivers change their work hours in\r\nresponse to a permanent wage change. Exploiting the effective wage\r\nincrease induced by a regulatory change in fares, I estimate the\r\nlong-run elasticity of labor supply to be -0.5. I show that the data\r\nlimitations may have biased the estimates in a previous study that also\r\nuse data for New York City taxicab drivers. Since the drivers are almost\r\nexclusively males, the estimate likely represents male labor supply\r\nelasticity. The negative elasticity is consistent with rising wages and\r\ndeclining work hours per worker observed over many decades and is useful\r\nevidence for policymakers to improve tax/ transfer systems.\r\nWorking Papers\r\nEquity of COVID-19-induced job loss\r\nduration and effect of unemployment insurance generosity on labor\r\nsupplyUnemployment insurance during COVID-19 had a small effect on\r\nIndiana’s unemployment.\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\nI study COVID-19-induced job losses using administrative data on the\r\nuniverse of Unemployment Insurance claims for the state of Indiana. I\r\nshow that during the pandemic, women and Blacks not only lost more jobs\r\nbut also stayed unemployed longer. I document sharp reductions in the\r\naggregate number of Unemployment Insurance recipients after the\r\nexpiration of the Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation (FPUC) and\r\nLost Wages Assistance (LWA) payments. Using difference-in-difference\r\nstrategy exploiting the eligibility for LWA benefits, I find that a\r\nchange in benefit amount by $300 per week is associated with a 30-35%\r\nchange in exit rate from unemployment in opposite direction. The\r\nunemployment rate in August 2020 would have been lower by 0.1 percentage\r\npoints if not for LWA. It is unlikely that these payments were a major\r\nfactor in explaining the difficulty business faced in finding workers in\r\nthe first half of 2021.\r\nContemporaneous and\r\nLasting Effects of Electoral Gender QuotasGender quotas in India increased women representation without large\r\nnegative effects.\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\nWe study the effect of gender quotas on election competitiveness, caste\r\ncomposition of the winning candidates, spillover effects at downstream\r\npositions, and their lasting effects after they are no longer binding.\r\nWe use newly compiled data on reserved seat quotas for women in village\r\ncouncils in the Indian state of Jharkhand for two consecutive elections.\r\nWe find that gender quotas reduce election competitiveness, but only in\r\nthe first round of elections, they do not affect the caste composition\r\nof the winning candidates, nor do they have any spillover effects on\r\nother lower hierarchy positions in the council. Village council head\r\npositions subjected to mandated reserved seat quotas continue to elect\r\nmore women as compared to those not subjected to the quotas, even after\r\nthe quotas are no longer binding. The results suggest that quotas are\r\nuseful when women are unable to win in their absence and that temporary\r\nelectoral gender quotas can be an effective policy tool to increase\r\nlong-run women’s political representation. The results are pertinent for\r\ntemporary affirmative action policies addressing other forms of\r\ndiscrimination.\r\nResearch in progress\r\nIntertemporal Elasticity of Labor Supply for Taxicab drivers:\r\nEvidence using a new instrumentDo workers work more if wages are high?\r\nEffect of Electoral Gender Quotas on Economic Development,\r\n(with Roshani Bulkunde)Do gender quotas affect economic development?\r\nNon-academic research\r\nDevelopment of an economy tracker for\r\nSouth Bend - Mishawaka regionPrincipal Investigator for work-travel transport subsidy\r\nprogram being implemented by the City of South Bend\r\n   - Report\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
