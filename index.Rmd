I am an Applied Microeconomist with research interests in Labor Economics. I currently work as Researcher in the California Policy Lab (CPL) at the University of California Los Angeles where I am part of a team focused on labor and employment. Before joining CPL, I worked as Assistant Research Professor and Postdoctoral Research Associate at the University of Notre Dame. 

I earned a PhD in Economics from the University of Arizona, an MA in Economics from the University of Texas at Austin, a Postgraduate Diploma in Management from Indian Institute of Management Shillong, and a Bachelor of Technology in Mechanical Engineering from Mumbai University, India.
