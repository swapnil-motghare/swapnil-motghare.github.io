I am a Researcher in the California Policy Lab (CPL) at UCLA where I am part of a team focused on labor and employment. Before joining CPL, I worked as Assistant Research Professor and Postdoctoral Research Associate at the University of Notre Dame. I completed my PhD in Economics from the University of Arizona in 2019.

I am an Applied Microeconomist with research interests in Labor Economics.
