**Motghare, S. (2021). [The long-run elasticity of labor supply: New evidence for new york city taxicab drivers.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0927537121000609) _Labour Economics_**
*New York City taxicab drivers worked fewer hours following a wage increase.*
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
I study how New York City taxicab drivers change their work hours in response to a permanent wage change. Exploiting the effective wage increase induced by a regulatory change in fares, I estimate the long-run elasticity of labor supply to be -0.5. I show that the data limitations may have biased the estimates in a previous study that also use data for New York City taxicab drivers. Since the drivers are almost exclusively males, the estimate likely represents male labor supply elasticity. The negative elasticity is consistent with rising wages and declining work hours per worker observed over many decades and is useful evidence for policymakers to improve tax/ transfer systems.\

## Working Papers
**[Equity of COVID-19-induced job loss duration and effect of unemployment insurance generosity on labor supply](files/ui_paper.pdf)**\
*Unemployment insurance during COVID-19 had a small effect on Indiana's unemployment.*
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
I study COVID-19-induced job losses using administrative data on the universe of Unemployment Insurance claims for the state of Indiana. I show that during the pandemic, women and Blacks not only lost more jobs but also stayed unemployed longer. I document sharp reductions in the aggregate number of Unemployment Insurance recipients after the expiration of the Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation (FPUC) and Lost Wages Assistance (LWA) payments. Using difference-in-difference strategy exploiting the eligibility for LWA benefits, I find that a change in benefit amount by $300 per week is associated with a 30-35% change in exit rate from unemployment in opposite direction. The unemployment rate in August 2020 would have been lower by 0.1 percentage points if not for LWA. It is unlikely that these payments were a major factor in explaining the difficulty business faced in finding workers in the first half of 2021.

**[Contemporaneous and Lasting Effects of Electoral Gender Quotas](files/gender_quotas_paper.pdf) (_Revise & Resubmit, World Development_)**\
*Gender quotas in India increased women representation without large negative effects.*
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
This paper examines ways in which electoral gender quotas affect the political system. I use newly compiled data on reserved seat quotas for women in village councils in the Indian state of Jharkhand. I find that gender quotas reduce electoral competitiveness, but only in the first round of elections. They do not affect the caste composition of the winning candidates, nor do they have any spillover effects on other lower hierarchy positions in the council. Village council head positions subjected to gender quotas continue to elect more women even after the quotas are no longer binding. These results suggest that women’s representation may be achieved without large negative effects and that temporary electoral gender quotas can be an effective policy tool to increase long-run women’s political representation. The results are pertinent for temporary affirmative action policies addressing other forms of discrimination.
